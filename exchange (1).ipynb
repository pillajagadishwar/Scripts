    "\n",
    "At AHL, we research and develop automated systems that trade in the world's financial markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trading in financial markets happens on \"exchanges\". On an exchange, participants such as AHL submit instructions (called \"orders\") to buy or sell a chosen amount of a given traded entity (called an \"instrument\"). For example, a participant may submit an order to buy 1000 shares of Microsoft stock, or to sell 10 lots of gold futures.\n",
    "\n",
    "As orders get submitted, the exchange maintains an accumulated view of all currently active orders (called the \"order book\"). For each traded instrument, each \"side\" (\"buy\" or \"sell\"), and each unique price point, the order book keeps track of how many units are being offered in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "The buy side contains price levels in decreasing order (the highest price a buyer is willing to pay is at the top). The sell side contains prices levels in increasing order (the cheapest sell price first).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: unit price will be provided in pence/cents of currency. For example `1.00` GBP will be written as `100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an order book for gold may look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Buy side:\n",
    "1) Price=1231, Total units=20\n",
    "2) Price=1225, Total units=45\n",
    "3) Price=1223, Total units=15 \n",
    "\n",
    "Sell side:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will look at a simplified version of an electronic exchange. Your task will be to design and implement a system that processes individual order submissions and maintains the order book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise is structured in steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* each step will ask you to write a function: each function performs a single task and each step will explain any necessary (or not needed) requirements;\n",
    "* all functions will be combined in the last question of the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is only one traded instrument: gold.\n",
    "* Each participant has only one type of action: submitting an order. Orders cannot be cancelled or modified.\n",
    "* There is only one type of order. The order contains information about the side (buy or sell), the quantity bought or sold, and the price.\n",
    "* On a real exchange, whenever a buyer is ready to pay more than what a seller is asking, their orders get \"matched\": a trade is made. For our purposes, we will NOT do order matching: it is perfectly fine to have such \"crossing\" buy and sell price levels on the order book.\n",
    "* While you can use any 3rd party libraries you would like, for most popular programming languages the standard library should be sufficient."
